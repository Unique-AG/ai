# SDK Deployment Mocks

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Disclaimer

**These files are illustrative examples only.** They demonstrate concepts and patterns for SDK assistant deployment but are not intended to be used as-is in any production, staging, or development environment.

### What This Is:
- ‚úÖ Educational examples showing deployment concepts
- ‚úÖ Structural templates to understand the deployment lifecycle
- ‚úÖ Reference patterns for building your own solutions

### What This Is NOT:
- ‚ùå This is not a ready-made solution
- ‚ùå This is not production code
- ‚ùå This is not security-tested or hardened
- ‚ùå This is not compliant with any specific standards
- ‚ùå This is not validated for any particular environment

### Your Responsibility:
Before using any concepts from these examples, you must:
- Conduct thorough security reviews and threat modeling
- Adapt all code to your specific infrastructure and requirements
- Implement proper testing, monitoring, and compliance measures
- Follow your organization's engineering and security standards
- Validate all configurations in non-production environments first

**Using these examples directly in any live environment is strongly discouraged and done at your own risk.**

## Overview

This folder contains a complete example of deploying SDK assistants through an 8-phase DevOps lifecycle. Each numbered folder represents a different phase:

# Example SDK Deployment

This folder contains **mocks** on how an SDK landscape to extend Unique (Apps) can be shaped.

> [!CAUTION]
> This folder contains pure example code meant only for illustration. These files are mocks. They are not real implementations. They do not reflect a full, working system, and they are not intended to be used as-is in any production, staging, or development environment.

## üö´ What This Is NOT

- ‚ùå This is not a ready-made solution.
- ‚ùå This is not production code.
- ‚ùå This is not a deployable or supported SDK setup.
- ‚ùå This is not guaranteed to work in your setup.
- ‚ùå This is not maintained or tested beyond its illustrative purpose.

## ‚úÖ What This IS

- ‚úÖ This is a mock. A sketch. A visual aid. A fake example to show what's possible, not what's right.
- ‚úÖ This is intended to inspire or guide thinking, not to be copied directly.
- ‚úÖ This is for educational or exploratory purposes only.

## üß† Important: You Must Build Your Own Real Implementation

The responsibility to shape and implement an SDK or extension landscape for your environment lies solely with you. You are expected to:

- Make technical decisions based on your own architecture and constraints
- Implement production-ready code according to your own engineering standards
- Ensure compliance, security, and testing according to your organization's policies

## üöÄ Get Started

Once you understand the disclaimer above, you can start reading in any DevOps section. The sections are organized to follow a typical software development lifecycle:

- **[0-plan](./0-plan/)** - Architecture planning and design decisions
- **[1-code](./1-code/)** - Example assistant implementation ([market_vendor](./1-code/market_vendor/))
- **[2-build](./2-build/)** - Containerization with [Dockerfile](./2-build/Dockerfile) and [SOPS keys](./2-build/SOPS_PUBLIC_KEYS)
- **[3-test](./3-test/)** - CI pipeline with [testing workflow](./3-test/market_vendor.ci.yaml)
- **[4-release](./4-release/)** - Release strategy and considerations
- **[5-deploy](./5-deploy/)** - Deployment with [Helm templates](./5-deploy/helm.template.yaml) and [CD workflows](./5-deploy/market_vendor.dev.cd.yaml)
- **[6-operate](./6-operate/)** - Operations and maintenance
- **[7-monitor](./7-monitor/)** - Monitoring and observability

## üìã Example Assistant: Market Vendor

The mock includes a complete example assistant called **Market Vendor** that demonstrates:

- **Flask-based web application** using the Unique SDK toolkit
- **SOPS encryption** for secure configuration management
- **Containerized deployment** with Docker and Helm
- **CI/CD pipelines** for testing and deployment
- **Multi-environment support** (dev, staging, prod)

Follow the numbered directories in order to understand the complete deployment pipeline from planning to monitoring.

### Key Concepts Demonstrated

- **Multi-phase DevOps lifecycle** from planning through monitoring
- **Containerized deployment** using Docker and Kubernetes
- **Infrastructure as Code** with Helm charts and workflows
- **Configuration management** using SOPS encryption (example approach only)
- **CI/CD automation** with GitHub Actions workflows
- **Environment separation** (dev/staging/prod patterns)
