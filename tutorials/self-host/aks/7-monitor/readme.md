## Monitor

### Disclaimer
Remember the [disclaimer](../). The monitoring approaches shown here are example patterns only.

This section demonstrates example monitoring and observability concepts that might be considered for SDK assistants. **These are illustrative patterns** - actual monitoring solutions must be designed according to your organization's specific requirements, compliance needs, and operational standards.

### Example Monitoring Areas

#### üìä Sample Metrics Collection
- Example patterns for application performance metrics
- Sample infrastructure monitoring approaches
- Illustrative business metrics tracking

#### üìù Example Logging Strategies
- Sample structured logging patterns
- Example log aggregation approaches
- Illustrative log retention and analysis

#### üîç Sample Tracing Approaches
- Example distributed tracing patterns
- Sample request flow monitoring
- Illustrative performance bottleneck identification

#### üö® Example Alerting Patterns
- Sample threshold-based alerting
- Example anomaly detection approaches
- Illustrative escalation and notification patterns

### Example Integration Points

These monitoring examples connect with:
- **[5-deploy](../5-deploy/)** - Shows how monitoring might be configured during deployment
- **[6-operate](../6-operate/)** - Demonstrates how monitoring data might inform operational decisions

### Sample Tools and Technologies

Examples of monitoring tools that might be considered:
- **Metrics**: Prometheus, Grafana, CloudWatch (examples only)
- **Logging**: ELK Stack, Fluentd, Splunk (examples only)  
- **Tracing**: Jaeger, Zipkin, OpenTelemetry (examples only)
- **Alerting**: PagerDuty, Slack, email notifications (examples only)

### Important Notes

**These are conceptual examples only.** Real monitoring solutions require:
- Proper data governance and privacy considerations
- Compliance with your organization's monitoring policies
- Appropriate data retention and security measures
- Trained personnel to interpret and act on monitoring data
- Regular review and tuning of monitoring configurations

### Next Steps

This completes the example deployment lifecycle. Review the **[main readme](../)** for a complete overview of all phases.

### üìä Monitoring Overview

Since the assistants run in the same Kubernetes cluster as Unique AI, you can monitor them using the same observability stack and procedures as other workloads.

### üîç Key Monitoring Areas

- **Application Metrics**: Request rates, response times, error rates
- **Infrastructure Metrics**: CPU, memory, network, and storage utilization
- **Logs**: Application logs, container logs, and system events
- **Health Checks**: Liveness and readiness probes

### üîó Integration Points

- **Deployment**: Monitoring builds on [5-deploy](../5-deploy/) configurations
- **Operations**: Supports [6-operate](../6-operate/) procedures
- **Architecture**: Implements observability from [0-plan](../0-plan/) design

### üìà Observability Stack

Typical monitoring components include:
- **Metrics Collection**: Prometheus, cloud provider monitoring services
- **Log Aggregation**: Fluentd, cloud provider log analytics
- **Visualization**: Grafana, cloud provider dashboards
- **Alerting**: AlertManager, cloud provider alerts
