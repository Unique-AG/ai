## Release

### Disclaimer
Remember the [disclaimer](../). The release processes shown here are example patterns only.

This section demonstrates how SDK assistants might move through a release pipeline once they've been built and validated. **This is an illustrative example** - actual release processes must be designed according to your organization's specific requirements and policies.

### Example Release Process

1. **Validation**: Example checks that might be performed on built artifacts
2. **Tagging**: Sample approaches to version management and artifact tagging  
3. **Promotion**: Example patterns for moving validated images through environments

### Sample Artifacts

This phase might typically handle:
- **Container Images**: Example patterns for managing validated container artifacts
- **Configuration**: Sample approaches to environment-specific configuration management
- **Documentation**: Example patterns for release notes and deployment guides

### Example Integration Points

This release phase example connects with:
- **[3-test](../3-test/)** - Shows how validated artifacts from testing might flow into release
- **[5-deploy](../5-deploy/)** - Demonstrates how released artifacts get deployed to environments

### Important Notes

**This is a conceptual example only.** Real release processes require:
- Proper approval workflows and governance
- Security scanning and vulnerability assessment
- Compliance validation according to your standards
- Rollback and recovery procedures
- Audit trails and change management

### Next Steps

See **[5-deploy](../5-deploy/)** for examples of how released artifacts might be deployed to target environments.
