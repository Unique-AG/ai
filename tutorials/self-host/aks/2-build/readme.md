## Build

### Disclaimer
Remember the [disclaimer](../). The build processes and configurations shown here are example patterns only.

This section demonstrates example approaches for building and containerizing SDK assistants. **These are illustrative examples** - actual build processes must be designed according to your organization's specific requirements, security policies, and development standards.

### Example Build Components

- **[`Dockerfile`](./Dockerfile)** - Sample multi-stage container build pattern for Python-based applications
- **[`SOPS_PUBLIC_KEYS`](./SOPS_PUBLIC_KEYS)** - Example public key format for configuration encryption

### Example Integration Points

These build examples connect with:
- **[1-code/market_vendor](../1-code/market_vendor/)** - Shows how source code might be containerized
- **[5-deploy/dockerize.template.yaml](../5-deploy/dockerize.template.yaml)** - Demonstrates how build processes might be automated
- **[3-test/market_vendor.ci.yaml](../3-test/market_vendor.ci.yaml)** - Shows how builds might be tested in CI pipelines

### Important Notes

**These are conceptual examples only.** Real build processes require:
- Proper security scanning and vulnerability assessment
- Compliance with your organization's container policies
- Appropriate base image selection and maintenance
- Secure handling of secrets and credentials during builds
- Validation and testing of built artifacts

### Next Steps

See **[3-test](../3-test/)** for examples of how built artifacts might be tested and validated.
