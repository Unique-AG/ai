## Test

### Disclaimer
Remember the [disclaimer](../). The testing strategies and configurations shown here are example patterns only.

This section demonstrates example testing approaches for SDK assistants, including sample automated testing and CI/CD integration patterns. **These are illustrative examples** - actual testing strategies must be designed according to your organization's specific quality standards, compliance requirements, and testing policies.

### Example Testing Components

- **[`market_vendor.ci.yaml`](./market_vendor.ci.yaml)** - Sample CI pipeline demonstrating linting, testing, and deployment validation patterns

### Example Testing Approaches

This example demonstrates concepts such as:

- **Code Quality**: Sample automated linting patterns with tools like Ruff
- **Unit Testing**: Example Python testing approaches with pytest and coverage reporting
- **Build Validation**: Sample Docker image build testing patterns
- **Deployment Testing**: Example Helm template validation and configuration checking

### Example Integration Points

These testing examples connect with:
- **[1-code/market_vendor](../1-code/market_vendor/)** - Shows how source code might be tested
- **[2-build/Dockerfile](../2-build/Dockerfile)** - Demonstrates how build artifacts might be validated
- **[5-deploy](../5-deploy/)** - Shows how deployment configurations might be tested

### Sample Testing Patterns

Examples of testing approaches that might be considered:
- Automated testing with configurable coverage thresholds
- Multi-environment validation with different test suites
- Integration testing across various deployment scenarios

### Important Notes

**These are conceptual examples only.** Real testing strategies require:
- Comprehensive test coverage appropriate to your application
- Proper test data management and security considerations
- Compliance with your organization's testing standards
- Integration with your existing CI/CD infrastructure
- Regular review and maintenance of test suites

### Next Steps

See **[4-release](../4-release/)** for examples of how tested artifacts might move through a release process.
