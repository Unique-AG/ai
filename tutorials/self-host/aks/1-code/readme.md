## Code

### Disclaimer
Remember the [disclaimer](../). The code structure and patterns shown here are for illustration purposes only.

This section contains example code for SDK assistants, demonstrating how applications might be structured for containerized deployment.

### Market Vendor Assistant Example

The `market_vendor/` directory shows an example Python-based SDK assistant with:

- **Example project structure** using Poetry for dependency management
- **Sample application code** demonstrating basic patterns
- **Illustrative configuration management** with SOPS encryption
- **Example containerization** with Docker
- **Sample testing setup** with pytest
- **Example deployment patterns** for Kubernetes environments

**Important**: This is a simplified example to demonstrate concepts. Real applications require:
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Proper security implementations
- Production-grade testing and monitoring
- Compliance with your organization's coding standards

### Key Files

- `pyproject.toml` - Example Poetry configuration
- `Dockerfile` - Sample containerization approach  
- `entrypoint.sh` - Example startup script pattern
- `deployment-values/` - Sample encrypted configuration files
- `market_vendor/` - Example application code structure
- `tests/` - Sample testing patterns

### Integration Points

This code example integrates with:
- **[2-build](../2-build/)** - Shows how the Dockerfile is used in the build process
- **[3-test](../3-test/)** - Demonstrates how CI pipelines might test this code
- **[5-deploy](../5-deploy/)** - Shows how the built container gets deployed

### Next Steps

See **[2-build](../2-build/)** for examples of how this code gets containerized and prepared for deployment.
