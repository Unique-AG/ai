## Deploy

### Disclaimer
Remember the [disclaimer](../). The deployment configurations and workflows shown here are example patterns only.

This section demonstrates example deployment approaches for SDK assistants using sample Helm and Kubernetes configurations. **These are illustrative examples** - actual deployment processes must be designed according to your organization's specific infrastructure, security policies, and operational requirements.

### Example Deployment Components

- **[`helm.template.yaml`](./helm.template.yaml)** - Sample GitHub Actions workflow pattern for Helm operations
- **[`dockerize.template.yaml`](./dockerize.template.yaml)** - Example Docker build and publish workflow template
- **[`market_vendor.dev.cd.yaml`](./market_vendor.dev.cd.yaml)** - Sample continuous deployment workflow for development environments
- **[`dev.helmfile.yaml`](./dev.helmfile.yaml)** - Example Helmfile configuration pattern
- **[`dev.values.yaml`](./dev.values.yaml)** - Sample Helm values for environment configuration

### Example Deployment Flow

This example demonstrates a deployment pattern such as:

1. **Build**: Sample Docker image creation using containerization templates
2. **Deploy**: Example Helm chart application using deployment templates
3. **Validate**: Sample deployment verification approaches

### Example Integration Points

These deployment examples connect with:
- **[1-code/market_vendor](../1-code/market_vendor/)** - Shows how source code might be deployed
- **[2-build/Dockerfile](../2-build/Dockerfile)** - Demonstrates how build artifacts might be containerized
- **[3-test](../3-test/)** - Shows how deployment configurations might be validated

### Example Architecture

The deployment examples follow concepts outlined in **[0-plan](../0-plan/)**, demonstrating patterns such as SOPS-based configuration management and multi-environment approaches.

### Important Notes

**These are conceptual examples only.** Real deployment processes require:
- Proper security hardening and access controls
- Compliance with your organization's deployment policies
- Appropriate resource allocation and scaling configurations
- Robust rollback and disaster recovery procedures
- Integration with your existing infrastructure and monitoring systems

### Next Steps

See **[6-operate](../6-operate/)** for examples of how deployed applications might be operated and maintained.
