# Development instructions

1. Install poetry on your system (through `brew` or `pipx`).

2. Install `pyenv` and install python 3.11. `pyenv` is recommended as otherwise poetry uses the python version used to install itself and not the user preferred python version.

3. If you then run `python --version` in your terminal, you should be able to see python version as specified in `.python-version`.

4. Then finally run `poetry install` to install the package and all dependencies.
