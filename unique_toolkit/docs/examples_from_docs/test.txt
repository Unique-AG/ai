# Harry Potter and the Whispering Halls

The clock in the Gryffindor common room struck midnight, and Harry was still awake. The castle had been unusually quiet all week, even for late November. The portraits whispered among themselves, and the staircases shifted more restlessly than usual, as if Hogwarts itself was uneasy.  

Ron had fallen asleep in an armchair, half-buried under a pile of Chocolate Frog wrappers. Hermione, on the other hand, sat across from Harry, surrounded by open books.  

> “I’ve checked every record of enchantments tied to the castle,” she said, frowning.  
> “There’s nothing about… voices in the walls.”  

Harry shivered. He’d heard them again that evening—soft, echoing words, not Parseltongue, but something equally ancient. They came from the stone itself, like the castle was breathing secrets.

## The Whisper

The next night, determined to find out more, Harry sneaked through the corridors under his Invisibility Cloak. The whispers grew stronger near the abandoned classrooms on the third floor, words curling through the air like smoke:  

*"Beware the one who binds the light…"*  

A flash of movement caught Harry’s eye. From the shadows emerged a pale, silvery figure—it was the ghost of Rowena Ravenclaw. Her normally serene face looked troubled.  

“Harry Potter,” she said softly, “you must listen. Hogwarts is not only walls and towers—it is alive. And it remembers. Something stirs, something that seeks to rewrite its very foundations.”  

Before Harry could ask more, she faded into the stone, leaving behind only the echo of her warning.

## The Book

The following day, Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood together in the library’s Restricted Section. Hermione traced her fingers over an ancient text that had appeared overnight on a shelf that had been empty for years.  

On the cracked leather cover, in silver letters, was written:  

**The Codex of Forgotten Wards.**  

As Hermione carefully opened the book, the pages trembled, and faint whispers spilled out. The same voice Harry had heard in the walls.  

Ron gulped.  

> “Brilliant. A haunted book. Because that’s *exactly* what we need.”  

Harry’s scar tingled faintly—not with Voldemort’s presence, but with something older, deeper, hidden in the magic of Hogwarts itself.

## The Choice

He knew then that their next adventure wasn’t about fighting a Dark Lord—it was about protecting the very soul of Hogwarts.  

And the castle had chosen them to uncover its secret.
