## Selective Language Modeling
Put weights on the weight of each token in the 

## Efficient Selective Modeling
How to weight token efficiently? ESLM
- VaR: Value at rist, CVar: Conditional Value at risk  
- Affects the the embedding layer predominantly.
- Compute efficiency by discarching instances of low value training 

Extension: Adaptive ESLM and Knowledge Destilation ESLM

## Robust Finetuning (FLORAL)

Issues with Poisining attacts

2019: Roberta was relatively stable until 10% of data was poisoned

Idea: Train SVM and identify most relevant sample by SVM support vectors
assure they are not poissend

# Speaker: Fanghui Liu - One step full gradient can suffice for low-rank fine-tuning
