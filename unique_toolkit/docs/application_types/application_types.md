# Application Types

Within the Unique platform there are two kind of entities. 

- User Interfaces e.g. the ChatInterface
- Standalone Entities: e.g. the Knowledge Base

User interfaces interact with the python domain via events and therefore we call applications that use UIs event driven applications. Standalone entities on the other hand can connect to the plattform directly via credentials and thus we call application that depende purely on standalone entities, standalone applications.
