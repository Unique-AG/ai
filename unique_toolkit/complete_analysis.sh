echo "🏆 OVERALL IMPACT:"
echo "=================="
echo ""

echo "📊 Code Quality:"
echo "  ✅ Eliminated hundreds of lines of duplication"
echo "  ✅ Centralized test data in single location"
echo "  ✅ Made tests more maintainable and readable"
echo "  ✅ Improved reusability across test suite"
echo "  ✅ Followed test_instructions.md principles"
echo ""

echo "📊 Maintainability:"
echo "  ✅ Single source of truth for test data"
echo "  ✅ Changes to base data propagate automatically"
echo "  ✅ Easy to add new test cases"
echo "  ✅ Consistent test structure across files"
echo ""

echo "📊 Developer Experience:"
echo "  ✅ Tests are easier to understand"
echo "  ✅ Less repetitive code to maintain"
echo "  ✅ Better IDE support with type annotations"
echo "  ✅ Clear separation of test logic and data"
