# Unique AI - SDK & Toolkit Documentation

👋 Welcome to the Unique AI SDK & Toolkit documentation. This repository contains multiple packages and tools developed by the Unique team.

## 🚀 Getting Started

If you have a usecase in mind that you want to implement on the Unique Platform, you can find implementation guidelines [here](usecase_realization_guidelines.md).

Depending on your usecase and needs, if you find yourself needing to develop an agent/module/mcp server then you can find instructions on how to do this using the **[Unique Toolkit](unique-toolkit/latest/)** package.

In addition to the Unique Toolkit, there are other accompanying packages that can be used to develop your own applications on the Unique Platform.

# Build versioned documentation locally (simulates CI)
./scripts/docs_build_versioned.sh --clean --serve

# Or build root site only for quick iteration
poetry run mkdocs serve
```
