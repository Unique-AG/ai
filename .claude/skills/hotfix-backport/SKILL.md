# Hotfix backport to `release/*`

## Workflow

1. Identify commits on `main` to backport (merge commits or PR numbers).
2. Branch from the target release branch:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin main release/YYYY.WW
   git checkout -b hotfix/UN-XXXXX origin/release/YYYY.WW
   ```
3. Cherry-pick in order (oldest first):
   ```bash
   git cherry-pick <sha1> <sha2> ...
   ```
4. Open a PR targeting `release/YYYY.WW` with a list of backported commits/PRs in the description.
5. Merge with **Rebase and merge** only (squash is blocked by branch rules).

## CI guardrails

- `.github/scripts/check-release-lineage.sh` — each PR commit must be on `main` or patch-equivalent (`git cherry -` prefix). Cherry-picks get new SHAs; identical hashes are not required.
- Do not squash-merge: one squashed commit breaks release-please changelog generation.

## After the fix PR merges

release-please opens `chore: hotfix release/YYYY.WW to YYYY.WW.N`. Approve and **rebase-merge** that PR too. PyPI publish follows the GitHub Release event.
