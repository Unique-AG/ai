## ‚ùî Q & A
### How to test against Monorepo

1. Go to `monorepo/python/assistants/bundles/core/src/pyproject.toml`
2. Update sdk and/or toolkit to point to your branch
    * `unique-sdk= {git = "https://github.com/Unique-AG/ai/", rev = "<your-branch>", subdirectory="unique_sdk"}`
    * `unique-toolkit = {git = "https://github.com/Unique-AG/ai/", rev = "<hash>", subdirectory="unique_toolkit"}`
3. Run `poetry lock` then `poetry install`

Now `assistanst core` environment is pointing to your new version and you can do smoke test and unittests 

### Poetry in monorepo dosen't find the lastest version

There can be delays in synchronization due to Poetry's caching mechanism. Please allow up to 20 minutes before raising a concern.
