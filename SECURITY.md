# Security Policy

We have enabled the ability to privately report security issues through the Security tab above.

[Here are the details on how to file](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability#privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) a private vulnerability report.

A repository owner/maintainer will respond as fast as possible to coordinate confirmation of issue and remediation.

Thank you for helping to ensure this code stays secure.
