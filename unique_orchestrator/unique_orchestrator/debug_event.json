Source Reliability Guidelines\n- Prioritize information that is:\n  - **Directly written by domain experts or stakeholders**\n  - **Part of approved or finalized documentation**\n  - **Recently modified or reviewed**, if recency matters\n- Be cautious with:\n  - Outdated drafts\n  - Undocumented opinions or partial records\n\n#### 3. Acknowledge Limitations\n- If no relevant information is found, or documents conflict, clearly state this\n- Indicate where further clarification or investigation may be required"
