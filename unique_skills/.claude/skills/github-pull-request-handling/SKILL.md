# PR and Review Comment Handling

Guides fetching unresolved PR conversations, addressing them with fixes, and replying with commit references.

## Prerequisites

- GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated
- `jq` for formatting (used by `pr-conversations.sh`)
- Current branch has an associated PR, or user provides PR number

## PR lifecycle focus

Stage: **Post-review conversation handling** (after review comments exist).

## Use Instead [if available]

- Use `pr-create` to draft/open a new PR.
- Use `pr-self-review` before requesting external review.
- Use `pr-review` for reviewer-side structured code review.

## Workflow

### 1. Fetch unresolved conversations

```bash
# From repository root (recommended):
./.claude/skills/github-pull-request-handling/scripts/pr-conversations.sh [PR_NUMBER]        # unresolved only (default)
./.claude/skills/github-pull-request-handling/scripts/pr-conversations.sh --all [PR_NUMBER]  # all threads
```

If your current working directory is different, use a repo-root-safe path:
```bash
"$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.claude/skills/github-pull-request-handling/scripts/pr-conversations.sh" [PR_NUMBER]
```

Uses the GitHub **GraphQL API** to fetch review threads with resolution status. Output:

- **○** unresolved thread
- **✓** resolved thread (only with `--all`)
- **⚠** outdated thread (code changed since comment)
- **●** first comment in the conversation
- **└** subsequent replies

Threads are sorted by file path and line number. Only act on **○ unresolved** threads.

### 2. Address each unresolved conversation

- **Read the full thread** — understand the root comment and any replies before acting
- **Create a test for bugs and fix them**
- **One commit per conversation**: Fix each issue in a separate commit for traceability
- Use conventional commit format: `fix(scope): description`

### 3. Reply via API with commit hash

**Use clickable links** so reviewers can jump to the commit:

```bash
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/PR_NUMBER/comments -X POST --input - <<'JSON'
{
  "body": "Fixed in [COMMIT_HASH](https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/commit/COMMIT_HASH)",
  "in_reply_to": COMMENT_ID
}
JSON
```

`in_reply_to` must be an **integer** (the `databaseId` from the script output).

### 4. Optional: summary comment

```bash
gh pr comment PR_NUMBER --body "Addressed all unresolved conversations:

1. **Topic** → [hash](https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/commit/hash)
2. **Topic** → [hash](https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/commit/hash)"
```

## Quick reference

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Unresolved conversations | `./.claude/skills/github-pull-request-handling/scripts/pr-conversations.sh [PR]` |
| All conversations | `./.claude/skills/github-pull-request-handling/scripts/pr-conversations.sh --all [PR]` |
| View PR | `gh pr view` |
| Add PR comment | `gh pr comment PR_NUMBER --body "..."` |
| Reply to comment | `gh api repos/.../pulls/PR_NUMBER/comments -X POST` with `in_reply_to` |
| Get repo owner/name | `gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner` |

## Commit hash format

- Use a short hash (typically 8 chars, e.g. `f16cfdae`)
- Link: `https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/commit/HASH`
- Markdown: `[f16cfdae](https://github.com/Unique-AG/ai/commit/f16cfdae)`
