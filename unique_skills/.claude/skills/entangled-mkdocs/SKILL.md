## What I do

I add new pages to an existing MkDocs + Entangled documentation site. I inspect the project's config and existing pages first, then produce a Markdown page with correct Entangled annotations, literate-programming prose, Mermaid diagrams where requested, and an updated `mkdocs.yaml`/`mkdocs.yml` nav entry.

## When to use me

- Document a module, algorithm, or feature
- Incorporate existing source code as annotated examples
- Add Mermaid diagrams to a page
- Register a new page in the site navigation

**Prerequisites**: `mkdocs.yaml`/`mkdocs.yml`, `docs/`, and `entangled.toml` must already exist.
Install: use uv or poetry (based on `pyproject.toml`) to add the following dependencies if missing:
`mkdocs-material mkdocs-entangled-plugin "entangled-cli>=2.0"` (`entangled-cli` installs the `entangled` command;
`>=2.0` required — `version = "2.0"` in `entangled.toml` is a v2 contract).

---

## Workflow

### 1 — Read (always first)

Complete all four preparation steps before writing anything:

**`mkdocs.yaml` or `mkdocs.yml`** (use whichever exists — keep the extension consistent):
- `docs_dir` (default: `docs`)
- Active `plugins:` — confirm `- entangled` is present; add it if missing
- Active `markdown_extensions:` — confirm `attr_list` and `pymdownx.superfences` are present (required by the plugin),
  and `pymdownx.tabbed` is present (required for Material tabbed content; if adding, also set `alternate_style: true` —
  without it Material falls back to legacy tab rendering); don't add duplicates
- `nav:` structure — note existing sections and any `!include` / external URL entries

**`entangled.toml`** — note the `watch_list` globs (these govern which `.md` files Entangled scans — not where `file=`
outputs may be written). Confirm the file has a `version` field (e.g. `version = "2.0"` — required; `entangled sync`
fails without it). If missing, add `version = "2.0"` to the file before proceeding.

**2–3 existing `docs/**/*.md` pages** (or all pages if fewer than 3 exist) — prefer pages with code blocks and
admonitions. Note heading style, admonition usage, and tangle output location (e.g. `docs/.python_files/`). Match these
conventions in your output. For non-Python projects fall back to `docs/.<lang>_files/<name>.<ext>` (e.g.
`docs/.ts_files/`).

**Block registry** — bootstrap the script if needed, then scan:

If `scripts/regenerate_registry.py` does not exist in the project, create the directory if needed and copy the script:

```bash
mkdir -p scripts
# then copy scripts/regenerate_registry.py from this skill's directory (alongside this SKILL.md)
```

```bash
python scripts/regenerate_registry.py
```

The script always overwrites `docs/entangled-registry.json` with the current state. Read that file and output a summary
**before proceeding to step 2**:

````
```registry-scan
# block IDs (count name)
  2 #some-duplicate-id
  1 #session-imports
...

# file= targets (count path)
  1 file=docs/.python_files/session.py
...
```
````

Any ID or path that appears is already claimed. If the script exits non-zero, the project has pre-existing duplicate
IDs — report them to the user and continue (they predate this session). Do not begin step 2 until this block is present
in your response.

### 2 — Write

Derive the filename in **kebab-case** from the topic (e.g. `session-management.md`). State the chosen filename
explicitly. If the topic maps to two or more equally plausible names (e.g. `auth.md` vs `authentication.md`), list them
and ask the user to choose before writing.

**Before writing**: check that `docs/<filename>.md` does not already exist. If it does, stop and ask the user whether to
overwrite, rename, or append.

Produce a new `.md` in `docs/`. Structure every section as **prose that introduces intent, followed by a code block or
diagram**. Never drop a bare block without context. Match the heading style, admonition usage, and prose tone of
existing pages.

Rules for every code block:

- Must have `file=` or `#id` (or both) — **except Mermaid blocks**, which are rendered not tangled and need neither
- Must not use an `#id` or `file=` path that appears in your registry (step 1), unless deliberate appending is
  intended — state that explicitly
- **Direct-append** (same `#id` repeated, output to file): the first block carries `file=`; subsequent blocks with
  the same `#id` are concatenated in document order. **Noweb assembly** (named sub-blocks assembled in a final block):
  sub-blocks like `#session-imports` must NOT carry `file=` — only the final assembly block does. **Cross-page append**:
  do not carry `file=` on the new page — the target is already registered on the defining page
- `file=` paths should stay within `docs/` by default; paths outside `docs/` will overwrite live source files when
  tangled — only use them if explicitly requested and confirmed by the user
- Use `docs/.python_files/<name>.py` as the default Python tangle path unless existing blocks show a different
  convention
- **Always use dot-prefixed language identifiers**: ` ```{.python ...} `, never ` ```{python ...} ` — the dot sets the
  CSS class (`.python` = `class="python"`) which both `pymdownx.superfences` and Entangled parse as the language
  identifier; a bare name is an attribute, not a class, and will not be recognised as a language. The plugin renders
  every `file=` block with a visible title bar; use `#id`-only if you want a block without a file-path header

If `pymdownx.arithmatex` is active, use `\(...\)` / `\[...\]` for math — not `$...$`. Note: `arithmatex` alone does not
render math; MathJax or KaTeX must also be configured via `extra_javascript`.

### 3 — Update nav and config

**Nav**: Find the existing `nav:` section whose topic best matches the new page and insert there. Create a new section
only if none fits. If no `nav:` block exists, create a minimal one listing existing pages plus the new one.

Never modify `!include` monorepo entries, external URL entries, or `mike`-versioning entries. Make the minimum change
necessary — do not reorder, rename, or remove any existing entries.

**Mermaid** (skip this section if the new page contains no Mermaid diagrams). Check `mkdocs.yaml`:

- `pymdownx.superfences` absent → add the full config below
- Present but missing `custom_fences:` → add just the custom fence block
- Already configured for Mermaid → do nothing

```yaml
markdown_extensions:
  - pymdownx.superfences:
      custom_fences:
        - name: mermaid
          class: mermaid
          format: !!python/name:pymdownx.superfences.fence_code_format
```

### 4 — Update block registry

Run the registry script again to capture the new page's block IDs and `file=` targets (step 1 scanned the pre-write
state; this records the post-write state for future sessions):

```bash
python scripts/regenerate_registry.py
```

Also add to `mkdocs.yaml` if not present (place at the **root level**, not under `plugins:` or `theme:`; requires
MkDocs ≥ 1.5):

```yaml
exclude_docs: |
  entangled-registry.json
```

Stage and commit in one commit. Always include:

- `docs/<new-page>.md`
- `docs/entangled-registry.json`

Also include if modified:

- `mkdocs.yaml` / `mkdocs.yml` (nav, `exclude_docs`, plugin, or extension changes)
- `scripts/regenerate_registry.py` (first use only)

### 5 — Preview

Search for a versioned build script anywhere under the repo (it may live in `scripts/`, `.github/scripts/`, or similar):

```bash
find . -name "docs_build_versioned.sh" -path "*/scripts/*" -not -path "*/node_modules/*" | head -1
```

Print the following command for the user to run (do not run it — it starts a live server):

If the `find` returns a path (e.g. `./.github/scripts/docs_build_versioned.sh`):

```bash
<found-path> --clean --serve   # clean, build, and serve at http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

Otherwise:

```bash
mkdocs serve       # preview at http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

The `- entangled` plugin runs the tangle step automatically before each build — no manual `entangled tangle` or `entangled sync` is needed.

**Task complete when**: (1) `docs/<new-page>.md` is committed, (2) `docs/entangled-registry.json` is updated and
committed, (3) `mkdocs.yaml` nav entry is present, and (4) the preview command has been printed. No further action is
required unless the user responds.

## Entangled syntax

All fenced code blocks **must** have `file=`, `#id`, or both. Mermaid blocks are exempt.

| Append               | Two blocks with the same `#id` are concatenated in document order. The first must carry `file=` only if it is the direct output target; for pure noweb assembly, `file=` on the first block is not required. When appending to a block defined on another page, do not add `file=` — it is already registered on the defining page |

Fences may be 3 or 4 backticks. Both forms are valid.

**Always use the dot-prefix language identifier** (`.python`, `.typescript`, `.bash`, etc.). The dot sets the CSS
class (`.python` = `class="python"`) which both `pymdownx.superfences` and Entangled parse as the language identifier. A
bare `{python ...}` is an attribute name, not a class, and will not be recognised as a language by either tool.

**Noweb example** (present concepts in narrative order, assemble in a final block):

````markdown
## Imports

The module needs `secrets` for token generation.

```{.python #session-imports}
import secrets
```

## Session class

`Session` stores a user ID and a random token.

```{.python #session-class}
class Session:
    def __init__(self, user_id: str):
        self.user_id = user_id
        self.token = secrets.token_hex(32)
```

## Assembled module

```{.python #session file=docs/.python_files/session.py}
<<session-imports>>
<<session-class>>
```
````

Use `#id` + noweb when code must be introduced out of narrative order or split across sections.

|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Read before write                 | Always read config, `entangled.toml`, and existing pages before generating output                                     |
| Build and output registry         | Run the registry script; output results in response; do not begin step 2 before this list is present in your response |
| No overwrite without confirmation | Check that the target `.md` path does not exist before writing; if it does, ask the user                              |
| No duplicate `#id`                | Never reuse an ID from the registry unless deliberately appending — state that explicitly                             |
| No conflicting `file=`            | Don't target a path already claimed; use named-block appending instead                                                |
| `file=` stays in `docs/`          | Only use `file=` paths outside `docs/` if explicitly requested — tangle will overwrite live source files              |
| Plugin guard                      | Only add plugins/extensions that are genuinely absent; never duplicate                                                |
| Preserve nav                      | Never touch `!include`, external URL, or `mike` entries; make minimum change                                          |
| Dot-prefix language identifiers   | Always write ` ```{.python} `, never ` ```{python} ` — bare names are attribute keys, not CSS classes                 |
| Real code only                    | Read actual source files; never invent placeholder code                                                               |
| Regenerate registry               | Run the registry script (step 4) and commit `docs/entangled-registry.json` with the page                              |
| Prefer docs script                | Search `**/scripts/docs_build_versioned.sh` via `find`; use it with `--clean --serve` if found, else `mkdocs serve`   |
