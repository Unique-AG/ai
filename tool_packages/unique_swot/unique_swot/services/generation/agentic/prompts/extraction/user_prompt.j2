Company: {{ company_name }}
Component to extract for: {{ component }}

Source chunks (preserve and cite these ids):
{% for chunk in source_batches -%}
[{{ chunk.id }}]
{{ chunk.text }}

{% endfor %}

Task:
- Extract rich, informative evidence units about {{ company_name }} that inform the {{ component }} dimension.
- FOCUS ON MATERIALITY: Extract only facts that are strategically significant and would matter to investors or executives making decisions.
- Prioritize: quantitative metrics, competitive advantages/disadvantages, material opportunities/risks, significant market/strategic shifts.
- Skip: routine operational matters, minor details, anecdotal points without strategic impact.
- Each fact should include sufficient context to be meaningful and build understanding (2-4 sentences when needed for complex topics).
- When you encounter claims about qualities (e.g., "best-in-class management," "strong position," "leading technology"), extract the reasoning, evidence, or metrics that support these claims.
- Extract definitions and explanations of any technical terms, acronyms, or industry-specific concepts mentioned.
- Include context that explains WHY something matters, HOW it works, or what its implications are.
- Ensure each fact tells part of a story and provides the depth needed for comprehensive analysis.
- Append the supporting chunk ids at the end of each fact in the format [chunk_id][chunk_id2] with all relevant chunks.

Quality over quantity: Extract fewer, more impactful facts that reveal material insights rather than comprehensive coverage of all details.

Output JSON:
{ "facts": ["<fact 1>", "..."] }
