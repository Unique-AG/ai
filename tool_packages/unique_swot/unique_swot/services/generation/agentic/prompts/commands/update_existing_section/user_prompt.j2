Instruction:
{{ instruction }}

Current section ({{model_name}} JSON):
{{ section }}

Facts to apply ( fact_id -> text):
{% for id, fact in facts.items() -%}
- [{{ id }}]: {{ fact }}
{% endfor %}

Important Guidelines:
- Follow the instruction carefully, using it as guidance for how to integrate the new facts and update the narrative.
- Retain or add the [chunk_id] citations from the facts when incorporating or revising content.
- Remove or revise any content that lacks support from the provided facts; every factual claim should have citations.
- Explain any technical terms, acronyms, or industry concepts encountered in the facts.
- Elaborate on each point: provide context, reasoning, and explain why it matters.
- Synthesize and integrate: When multiple facts (new or existing) address closely related points, weave them together into cohesive entries rather than creating separate entries for each.
- Substantiate all evaluative claims (e.g., "strong," "best-in-class," "leading") with specific evidence from the facts.
- Build a coherent narrative that progresses logically through the topic.
- When integrating new facts, weave them seamlessly into the existing narrative structure.
- Do not remove accurate, relevant existing content unless it conflicts with the new facts.
- Focus on the most material, impactful insights—depth on what matters most, not exhaustive coverage.
- Favor fewer, richer entries that integrate related points over many brief, fragmented entries.

Update the section to reflect the instruction, grounded solely in the facts.
