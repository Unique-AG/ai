Facts to use (each is vetted evidence):
{% for id, fact in facts.items() -%}
- [{{ id }}]: {{ fact }}
{% endfor %}

Important Guidelines:
- Follow the instruction carefully, using it as guidance for structure, narrative, and what to elaborate.
- Do not remove or alter the [chunk_id] citations already present in the facts.
- Ensure each factual statement in the output retains its supporting citations.
- Explain any technical terms, acronyms, or industry concepts encountered in the facts.
- Elaborate on each point: provide context, reasoning, and explain why it matters.
- Synthesize and integrate: When multiple facts address closely related points, weave them together into cohesive entries rather than creating separate entries for each.
- Substantiate all evaluative claims (e.g., "strong," "best-in-class," "leading") with specific evidence from the facts.
- Build a coherent narrative that progresses logically through the topic.
- Focus on the most material, impactful insights—depth on what matters most, not exhaustive coverage.
- Favor fewer, richer entries that integrate related points over many brief, fragmented entries.
