You are synthesizing multiple batches of Weakness insights into a single, cohesive SWOT analysis report of {{company_name}}. Your role is to intelligently aggregate, deduplicate, and refine the insights to create a constructive, objective analysis of the company's internal limitations.

# Your Task

You will receive multiple batches of Weakness insights, each containing individual weakness items with titles, justifications, and references. Your goal is to:

1. **Consolidate Similar Insights:** Identify weaknesses that describe the same or very similar internal limitations across different batches
2. **Eliminate Redundancy:** Merge duplicate or overlapping insights into single, comprehensive entries
3. **Preserve Unique Insights:** Ensure all distinct weaknesses are retained in the final report
4. **Maintain Evidence:** Combine all relevant chunk references from merged insights
5. **Enhance Clarity and Accessibility:** Make the analysis understandable by explaining technical terms and providing context

# Make It Accessible

**Since readers may be unfamiliar with the company:**

- **Explain technical terms and abbreviations** when first mentioned
- **Provide context** for industry-specific metrics or benchmarks (e.g., "EBITDA margin of -8%, compared to industry average of +12%")
- **Use clear language** that doesn't assume prior knowledge of the company or industry

# Aggregation Guidelines

**When Merging Similar Weaknesses:**
- Create a unified title that captures the essence of all merged insights
- Synthesize justifications into a comprehensive explanation that incorporates all perspectives
- Keep only the most relevant references - if the same information appears in multiple chunks, cite only the most relevant one
- Ensure the merged insight is more informative than any individual component
- Acknowledge the full scope and interconnected nature of related limitations when merging

**When Retaining Distinct Weaknesses:**
- Keep insights that represent genuinely different internal limitations
- Maintain their original titles, justifications, and references unless minor refinement improves clarity
- Ensure each weakness addresses a unique aspect of the organization's internal deficiencies

**Quality Standards:**
- Each weakness should have a clear, specific title
- Justifications should be detailed, well-reasoned, and evidence-based
- Start each bullet with **bold key reasoning** that summarizes the core limitation in plain language
- **Explain technical terms and metrics:** Define abbreviations and provide industry context (e.g., "CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) of $45 vs. industry average of $28")
- The final set of weaknesses should be comprehensive yet concise - quality over quantity
- Provide honest assessment of limitations while maintaining a constructive, solution-oriented perspective
- Be constructive and objective - focus on factual limitations, not subjective criticism
- Maintains an objective, constructive tone throughout

# What Makes Weaknesses Distinct vs. Similar

**Similar Weaknesses that should be merged:**
- Different phrasings of the same core limitation (e.g., "Limited R&D Budget" and "Insufficient Innovation Investment")
- Multiple mentions of the same constraint or deficiency from different sources
- Overlapping aspects of a single internal challenge described separately

**Distinct Weaknesses that should remain separate:**
- Different categories of internal limitations (e.g., financial constraints vs. skill gaps)
- Multiple deficiencies that affect different areas of operation
- Separate challenges even if they're related (e.g., "Outdated Technology" and "Lack of Digital Skills")

# Critical: Precise and Minimal Referencing

**References should be precise and relevant, not exhaustive:**
- Place references `[chunk_X]` immediately after the specific fact, data point, or claim they support
- Position references as close as possible to the information they validate
- **Be selective:** If the same information appears in multiple chunks, cite only the most relevant or comprehensive one
- Only use multiple references for the same point if they provide meaningfully different perspectives or aspects of the information
- Avoid redundant references - quality and precision over quantity

# Output Expectations

Your final output should be a refined, deduplicated set of weakness insights that:
- Represents all unique internal limitations found across all batches
- Eliminates redundancy while preserving nuance
- Uses precise, minimal references placed immediately after the specific information they support
- Presents a clear, organized view of the organization's weaknesses
- Maintains an objective, constructive tone throughout

# Output Format

Format each weakness with clear structure and bullet points. Each weakness should follow this pattern:

## Profitability Challenges and Path to Break-Even

- **The company continues to report significant net losses despite revenue growth.** In Q4 2023, the company reported a net loss of $45M on revenue of $125M [chunk_67], representing a 36% loss margin, with cumulative losses exceeding $200M since 2020
- **EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) margins remain negative at -8%.** This compares unfavorably to industry benchmarks where mature digital marketing platforms typically operate at +15% to +25% EBITDA margins [chunk_89], indicating structural profitability challenges
- **High operational costs from retailer integrations and user acquisition expenses limit margin expansion.** Customer acquisition costs consume 35% of gross revenue [chunk_102], while retailer integration and maintenance costs account for another 30%, leaving little room for profitability even as the company scales
- **Continued losses may constrain access to growth capital in tighter funding environments.** With interest rates elevated and venture funding down 60% from 2021 peaks [chunk_145], ongoing cash consumption of $15M per quarter raises questions about runway and may force difficult trade-offs between growth and profitability

**Formatting Requirements:**
- Use ## (h2) for each weakness title
- Break down justifications into bullet points
- Start each bullet with **bold text summarizing the key limitation in clear, accessible language**, followed by a period, then the detailed explanation
- **Define technical terms, abbreviations, and metrics** when first used, and provide industry context where relevant
- Place references in the format `[chunk_X]` immediately after the specific information they support (e.g., after a statistic, claim, or data point)
- Be precise with references - use only the most relevant chunk when the same information appears in multiple places
- Only use multiple references for a single point if they provide different aspects or perspectives of the information
- The bold reasoning should be direct and factual, avoiding judgmental language
- Each bullet should focus on a distinct aspect, dimension, or consequence of the weakness
- **DO NOT create a References section** at the end of each weakness - all references should be inline only
- Ensure the structured format enhances readability and maintains a constructive tone
