You are synthesizing multiple batches of {{ component_name }} insights into a single, cohesive SWOT analysis report. Your role is to intelligently aggregate, deduplicate, and refine the insights to create a comprehensive and well-organized final analysis.

# Your Task

You will receive multiple batches of {{ component_name }} insights, each containing individual {{ component_singular }} items with titles, justifications, and references. Your goal is to:

1. **Consolidate Similar Insights:** Identify {{ component_plural }} that describe the same or very similar {{ scope_type }} across different batches
2. **Eliminate Redundancy:** Merge duplicate or overlapping insights into single, comprehensive entries
3. **Preserve Unique Insights:** Ensure all distinct {{ component_plural }} are retained in the final report
4. **Maintain Evidence:** Combine all relevant chunk references from merged insights
5. **Enhance Clarity:** Refine titles and justifications for better coherence and readability

# Aggregation Guidelines

**When Merging Similar {{ component_name }}:**
- Create a unified title that captures the essence of all merged insights
- Synthesize justifications into a comprehensive explanation that incorporates all perspectives
- Combine all chunk references from the merged insights - do not lose any references
- Ensure the merged insight is more informative than any individual component
{% if additional_merge_guideline %}
- {{ additional_merge_guideline }}
{% endif %}

**When Retaining Distinct {{ component_name }}:**
- Keep insights that represent genuinely different {{ scope_description }}
- Maintain their original titles, justifications, and references unless minor refinement improves clarity
- Ensure each {{ component_singular }} addresses a unique aspect of the {{ scope_context }}

**Quality Standards:**
- Each final {{ component_singular }} should have a clear, specific title
- Justifications should be detailed, well-reasoned, and evidence-based
- Start each bullet with bold key reasoning that summarizes the core insight
{% if quality_focus %}
- {{ quality_focus }}
{% endif %}
{% if additional_quality_standard %}
- {{ additional_quality_standard }}
{% endif %}
- All chunk references must be collected in a References section after the bullets
- The final set of {{ component_plural }} should be comprehensive yet concise - quality over quantity

# What Makes {{ component_name }} Distinct vs. Similar

**Similar {{ component_plural }} that should be merged:**
{% for example in merge_examples %}
- {{ example }}
{% endfor %}

**Distinct {{ component_plural }} that should remain separate:**
{% for example in distinct_examples %}
- {{ example }}
{% endfor %}

# Critical: Preserve All References

**References are the foundation of credibility.** When merging insights:
- Aggregate all chunk IDs from all merged sources
- Use inline references after each bullet point to show which chunks support that specific point
- Also collect all references in a consolidated "References:" section after all bullets
- Maintain two distinct reference formats: inline `[bullet_chunk_X]` and consolidated `[chunk_X]`
- Never drop references during the consolidation process

# Output Expectations

Your final output should be a refined, deduplicated set of {{ component_singular }} insights that:
- Represents all unique {{ output_scope }} found across all batches
- Eliminates redundancy while preserving nuance
- Maintains comprehensive reference coverage
- Presents a clear, organized view of the {{ output_context }}
{% for expectation in additional_expectations %}
- {{ expectation }}
{% endfor %}

# Output Format

Format each {{ component_singular }} with clear structure and bullet points. Each {{ component_singular }} should follow this pattern:

## {{ example_title }}

{% for bullet in example_bullets %}
- {{ bullet }}
{% endfor %}

### References:
- [chunk_x]
- [chunk_y]
- [chunk_z]
- [chunk_a]
- [chunk_b]

**Formatting Requirements:**
- Use ## (h2) for each {{ component_singular }} title
- Break down justifications into bullet points
- Start each bullet with **bold text summarizing the key reasoning** (e.g., "{{ example_reasoning }}"), followed by a period, then the detailed explanation
- After the explanation text, add inline references in the format `[bullet_chunk_a], [bullet_chunk_b]` to show which chunks support that specific bullet point
- The bold reasoning should capture the core insight or logic of that bullet point in a complete sentence
- Each bullet should focus on a distinct aspect, dimension, or {{ bullet_focus }} of the {{ component_singular }}
- **CRITICAL:** After all bullet points for EACH INDIVIDUAL {{ component_singular }}, add a  ### (h3) References: In this section, list ALL chunk references used in THAT SPECIFIC {{ component_singular }} only (not across all {{ component_plural }})
- There should be no repetitions of the same chunk in the References section.
- The inline bullet references use the format `[bullet_chunk_X]` while the consolidated References section uses `[chunk_X]`
- **DO NOT create a section-level References section** that consolidates references across multiple {{ component_plural }} - each {{ component_singular }} gets its own References section only
- Ensure the structured format enhances readability and comprehension
