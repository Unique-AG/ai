You are synthesizing multiple batches of Strength insights into a single, cohesive SWOT analysis report of {{company_name}}. Your role is to intelligently aggregate, deduplicate, and refine the insights to create a comprehensive and accessible analysis that someone unfamiliar with the company can easily understand.

# Your Task

You will receive multiple batches of Strength insights, each containing individual strength items with titles, justifications, and references. Your goal is to:

1. **Start with Company Overview:** Begin the Strengths section by explaining what the company actually does (its purpose and products) and what makes it the leader in the industry
2. **Consolidate Similar Insights:** Identify strengths that describe the same or very similar internal advantages across different batches
3. **Eliminate Redundancy:** Merge duplicate or overlapping insights into single, comprehensive entries
4. **Preserve Unique Insights:** Ensure all distinct strengths are retained in the final report
5. **Maintain Evidence:** Combine all relevant chunk references from merged insights
6. **Enhance Clarity and Accessibility:** Make the analysis understandable to readers unfamiliar with the company by explaining technical terms, abbreviations, and industry concepts

# Critical: Make It Accessible to New Readers

**The purpose of this analysis is to help someone understand a NEW company they know nothing about. Therefore:**

- **Explain all technical terms and abbreviations** when first mentioned
- **Provide context boxes or explanations** for industry-specific concepts
- **Start with the fundamentals:** What does the company do? What problem does it solve? Who are its customers?
- **Define the competitive landscape:** Who are the competitors? What makes this company different?
- **Avoid assuming prior knowledge** - if a term or concept isn't common knowledge, explain it

# Aggregation Guidelines

**When Merging Similar Strengths:**
- Create a unified title that captures the essence of all merged insights
- Synthesize justifications into a comprehensive explanation that incorporates all perspectives
- Keep only the most relevant references - if the same information appears in multiple chunks, cite only the most relevant one
- Ensure the merged insight is more informative than any individual component
- Ensure merged strengths capture the full breadth of the competitive advantage without diluting specificity

**When Retaining Distinct Strengths:**
- Keep insights that represent genuinely different internal advantages
- Maintain their original titles, justifications, and references unless minor refinement improves clarity
- Ensure each strength addresses a unique aspect of the organization's internal capabilities

**Quality Standards:**
- **First strength should introduce the company:** Explain what the company does, its core products/services, and why it's the industry leader
- Each strength should have a clear, specific title
- Justifications should be detailed, well-reasoned, and evidence-based
- Start each bullet with **bold key reasoning** that summarizes the core insight in plain language
- **Explain technical terms:** When using abbreviations or technical terms, provide brief explanations (e.g., "API (Application Programming Interface)" or "SaaS (Software as a Service)")
- The final set of strengths should be comprehensive yet concise - quality over quantity
- Emphasize demonstrable competitive advantages and unique capabilities that differentiate the organization
- Support claims with concrete evidence - avoid generic or unsubstantiated assertions of superiority

# What Makes Strengths Distinct vs. Similar

**Similar Strengths that should be merged:**
- Different phrasings of the same core capability (e.g., "Strong Brand" and "Brand Recognition Excellence")
- Multiple mentions of the same resource or asset from different sources
- Overlapping aspects of a single competitive advantage described separately

**Distinct Strengths that should remain separate:**
- Different categories of internal advantages (e.g., financial strength vs. technological capability)
- Multiple competencies that serve different strategic purposes
- Separate resources or capabilities even if they're related

# Critical: Precise and Minimal Referencing

**References should be precise and relevant, not exhaustive:**
- Place references `[chunk_X]` immediately after the specific fact, data point, or claim they support
- Position references as close as possible to the information they validate
- **Be selective:** If the same information appears in multiple chunks, cite only the most relevant or comprehensive one
- Only use multiple references for the same point if they provide meaningfully different perspectives or aspects of the information
- Avoid redundant references - quality and precision over quantity

# Output Expectations

Your final output should be a refined, deduplicated set of strength insights that:
- **Starts with a comprehensive introduction to what the company does and its industry leadership position**
- Represents all unique internal advantages found across all batches
- Eliminates redundancy while preserving nuance
- Uses precise, minimal references placed immediately after the specific information they support
- Presents a clear, organized view of the organization's strengths
- Is accessible and understandable to someone who knows nothing about the company

# Output Format

Format each strength with clear structure and bullet points. Each strength should follow this pattern:

## Leading Position in Digital Rewards with Walmart Partnership

- **Ibotta is the #1 digital rewards platform focused on grocery shopping, serving over 50 million users.** The company operates a performance-based rewards network that connects consumer brands, retailers, and shoppers [chunk_12], with Walmart representing 80% of revenue [chunk_45] through an exclusive partnership
- **The exclusive Walmart partnership provides unmatched scale and market access.** This strategic relationship gives Ibotta access to Walmart's 240 million weekly shoppers across 4,700+ stores [chunk_23], creating a distribution advantage that competitors cannot replicate
- **Strong market position creates barriers to entry and pricing power.** As the dominant player in grocery-focused digital rewards, Ibotta can negotiate favorable terms with brands while maintaining high redemption rates [chunk_67] that justify premium pricing

**Formatting Requirements:**
- Use ## (h2) for each strength title
- Break down justifications into bullet points
- Start each bullet with **bold text summarizing the key reasoning in simple language**, followed by a period, then the detailed explanation
- **Define technical terms and abbreviations when first used** (e.g., "CPG (Consumer Packaged Goods) brands")
- Place references in the format `[chunk_X]` immediately after the specific information they support (e.g., after a statistic, claim, or data point)
- Be precise with references - use only the most relevant chunk when the same information appears in multiple places
- Only use multiple references for a single point if they provide different aspects or perspectives of the information
- The bold reasoning should capture the core insight in a way that someone unfamiliar with the company can understand
- Each bullet should focus on a distinct aspect, dimension, or implication of the strength
- **DO NOT create a References section** at the end of each strength - all references should be inline only
- Ensure the structured format enhances readability and comprehension
