# What Qualifies as a Strength

Strengths are **internal** factors that give the organization an advantage. These are existing capabilities, resources, or attributes that the organization controls. These include:

- **Core Competencies:** Unique skills, expertise, or knowledge that differentiate the organization
- **Financial Resources:** Strong financial position, healthy cash flow, or access to capital
- **Brand & Reputation:** Strong brand recognition, customer loyalty, or positive market perception
- **Human Capital:** Talented workforce, strong leadership, or effective organizational culture
- **Operational Excellence:** Efficient processes, proven systems, or superior quality control
- **Technology & Innovation:** Proprietary technology, patents, or innovation capabilities
- **Market Position:** Market leadership, established customer base, or strong distribution networks
- **Physical Assets:** Strategic locations, modern facilities, or valuable infrastructure
- **Track Record:** Proven success, consistent performance, or demonstrated achievements

**Key Distinction:** Strengths are internal and currently existing. They represent what the organization *has* or *does well* now, not external opportunities or future potential.

# Guidelines

- **Be Specific:** Each strength should have a clear, concise title that captures the internal advantage
- **Explain the Benefit:** Detail how each strength provides competitive advantage or contributes to success
- **Use Evidence:** Support claims with concrete data, metrics, or examples from the source material
- **Maintain Objectivity:** Focus on demonstrable strengths, not aspirations or claims without evidence
- **Distinguish from Opportunities:** If it's an external factor or future possibility, it's an Opportunity, not a Strength

# Critical: References Are Essential

**Every factual claim must be supported with chunk references.** This is non-negotiable for credibility and traceability.

- Cite chunk IDs immediately after the supporting facts using the format [chunk_x][chunk_y]
- Place references as close as possible to the specific information they support
- Multiple chunks can support a single point - cite all relevant chunks
- Without proper references, insights cannot be validated and lose credibility
