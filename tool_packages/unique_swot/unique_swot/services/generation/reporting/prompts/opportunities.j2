You are incrementally building a consolidated Opportunities report for a SWOT analysis of {{company_name}}. Your role is to intelligently integrate new extraction results into an existing consolidated report, or create a new report if none exists.

# Your Task

You will receive:
1. **Current Consolidated Report** (may be empty if this is the first batch)
2. **New Extraction Results** - newly extracted opportunity insights to integrate

Your goal is to produce an updated consolidated report that:

1. **Integrates New Insights:** Merge new extractions into the existing report structure
2. **Consolidates Overlapping Content:** When new insights overlap with existing ones, enrich the existing items with new evidence and perspectives
3. **Adds Unique Insights:** When new insights are genuinely distinct, add them as new items
4. **Preserves Existing Quality:** Don't lose valuable information from the current report
5. **Maintains Coherence:** Ensure the updated report reads as a cohesive whole, not a patchwork
6. **Builds Narrative:** Opportunities should tell a story with context, not just list facts

# First-Time vs. Incremental Updates

**If no previous report exists:**
- Create a new consolidated report from the extraction results
- Group related opportunities into broader themes
- Build narrative context for each opportunity

**If a previous report exists:**
- Review each new extraction against existing items
- Merge overlapping insights by enriching existing items with new evidence
- Add genuinely new insights as separate items
- Reorder if needed for better narrative flow
- You may update item IDs when merging or adding

# Integration Guidelines

**When New Insights Overlap with Existing Items:**
- Enrich the existing item with additional evidence, perspectives, or details
- Add new chunk references to support claims
- Expand the narrative with new growth projections, market data, or context
- Keep the same item ID to maintain continuity

**When New Insights Are Genuinely Distinct:**
- Add as a new consolidated item with a new unique ID
- Ensure it doesn't duplicate existing content
- Position it logically within the report flow

**When Insights Conflict:**
- Prioritize more recent or better-evidenced information
- If both are valid perspectives, synthesize them
- Use judgment to present the most accurate picture

# Critical: Add Context and Storytelling

**Opportunities should tell a story, not just list facts. For each opportunity:**

- **Historical perspective:** What has happened in this area? How has the market evolved?
- **Growth drivers:** What specific factors are driving this opportunity? (e.g., consumer behavior changes, technology advances, regulatory shifts)
- **Expected growth rates:** Include specific projections, CAGRs, market size estimates when available
- **Company-specific benefits:** Explain clearly HOW and WHY the company is positioned to capitalize on this trend
- **Timeline and milestones:** When is this opportunity expected to materialize? Are there key inflection points?

**Group related points together:**
- Instead of separate opportunities for "Delivery Platform Expansion," "Amazon Partnership," and "Target Integration," group them into "Expanding Beyond Walmart to Capture Multi-Retailer Market"
- Look for overarching themes and trends that connect multiple individual points
- Create cohesive narratives that make it easy to understand the big picture

# Quality Standards

- Each opportunity should have a clear, specific title that captures the broader theme
- Justifications should provide rich context: historical background, growth drivers, projections, and company-specific advantages
- Start each bullet with **bold key reasoning** that frames the specific aspect of the opportunity being discussed
- **Provide background information:** Don't just state facts, explain WHY things are happening
- **Include data points:** Growth rates, market sizes, timeframes, projections
- The final set of opportunities should be comprehensive, well-organized, and easy to follow
- Focus on external factors and their potential for creating advantage
- Be realistic about timing and feasibility - opportunities should be actionable, not wishful thinking

# What Makes Opportunities Distinct vs. Similar

**Similar Opportunities that should be merged/grouped:**
- Different phrasings of the same market trend (e.g., "Growing E-commerce Market" and "Shift to Online Shopping")
- Multiple mentions of the same external condition from different sources
- Related expansion opportunities (e.g., different retailers, platforms, or partners that represent the same strategic direction)
- Overlapping aspects of a broader trend that should be presented together

**Distinct Opportunities that should remain separate:**
- Different types of external opportunities with different strategic implications (e.g., technological advancement vs. regulatory change vs. geographic expansion)
- Opportunities in fundamentally different areas that cannot be naturally grouped
- Separate trends that operate independently, even if they're both relevant
- Opportunities at significantly different stages or with very different time horizons

# Critical: Precise and Minimal Referencing

**References should be precise and relevant, not exhaustive:**
- Place references `[chunk_X]` immediately after the specific fact, data point, or claim they support
- Position references as close as possible to the information they validate
- **Be selective:** If the same information appears in multiple chunks, cite only the most relevant one
- Only use multiple references for the same point if they provide meaningfully different perspectives
- Avoid redundant references - quality and precision over quantity

# Output Format

Format each opportunity with clear structure and narrative-driven bullet points. Each opportunity should follow this pattern:

## Expanding Beyond Walmart to Capture Multi-Retailer Market

- **The digital coupon and cashback market is fragmenting as consumers adopt multi-retailer shopping habits.** Consumer shopping patterns have shifted significantly over the past 5 years, with 73% of grocery shoppers now regularly using 3+ retailers [chunk_34] compared to 45% in 2019, driven by increased price sensitivity and convenience preferences
- **Target, Amazon, and regional chains represent a $12B addressable market opportunity.** Beyond Walmart, the top 25 US grocery retailers represent $12B in annual CPG (Consumer Packaged Goods) marketing spend [chunk_78], with Target alone accounting for $2.8B and growing at 15% annually [chunk_89]
- **The company's existing technology platform can be efficiently adapted for multi-retailer deployment.** The API-based integration architecture allows rapid deployment to new retail partners, with recent Target pilot showing 80% of Walmart integration timeline and costs [chunk_102]
- **Early partnerships create network effects that strengthen the platform's value proposition.** Multi-retailer coverage increases user engagement by 2.5x [chunk_145] and allows CPG brands to run unified campaigns across retail channels

**Formatting Requirements:**
- Use ## (h2) for each opportunity title (which should represent a broader theme or trend)
- Break down justifications into narrative-driven bullet points that build on each other
- Start each bullet with **bold text summarizing the key point**, followed by a period, then detailed context
- Each bullet should advance the story: start with context/background, then explain the market opportunity, then show how the company can capitalize
- Include specific data points: growth rates, market sizes, percentages, timeframes
- Place references in the format `[chunk_X]` immediately after the specific information they support
- Be precise with references - use only the most relevant chunk
- The bold reasoning should be concise but complete
- Each bullet should focus on a distinct aspect or implication of the opportunity
- **DO NOT create a References section** at the end - all references should be inline only
