Company: {{ company_name }}

Source candidate (top {{ selected_chunks | length }} chunks):
{% for chunk in selected_chunks %}
[{{ loop.index }} | id={{ chunk.id }}]
{{ chunk.text }}

{% endfor %}
Task
- Determine whether this source should be selected for the SWOT analysis of {{ company_name }}.
- Base your decision only on the text above.
- If the source is off-topic, too generic, or provides little actionable insight, set should_select to false.

Output
- Follow the schema: should_select (bool), reason (brief, cite the key chunk ids/indices that informed the decision), notification_message (short progress/status note for the user).
