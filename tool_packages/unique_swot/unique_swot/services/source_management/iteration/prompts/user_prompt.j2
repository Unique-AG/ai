Please analyze and order the following sources:

{% for content in contents %}
---
Source ID: {{ content.id }}
Document Title: {{ content.document_title }}

Content Preview:
{{ content.chunks }}
---

{% endfor %}

Based on the analysis of these sources, please:
1. Order the sources according to the objective
2. Provide the order number (starting from 1) for each source
3. Explain your reasoning for each source's position
4. Generate a brief notification message (1-2 sentences) summarizing the ordering results

Return your analysis in the structured format with:
- ordered_sources: A list containing each source's id, order number, and reasoning
- notification_message: A concise summary of the ordering (e.g., "Successfully ordered 5 sources from oldest to newest based on publication dates")

⚠️ CRITICAL: When returning ordered_sources, you MUST use the EXACT Source ID shown above for each source. 
- Copy the Source ID exactly as provided - character-for-character, including any special characters, numbers, or formatting
- Do NOT modify, shorten, or create new IDs
- Do NOT hallucinate or make up IDs that were not explicitly provided above
- Each "id" field in your response must match exactly with one of the "Source ID" values listed above

Note: If you cannot confidently determine the order for certain sources, you may exclude them from the ordered_sources list.
