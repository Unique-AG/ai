   - Define all acronyms and technical terms when first introduced
   - Provide clear explanations of any technologies mentioned (e.g., if the company uses machine learning, blockchain, specific frameworks, or proprietary technology)
   - Help non-technical investors understand WHY these technologies matter for the business
   - Always keep the source citations with these explanations

4. **Makes Each SWOT Section Investor-Friendly**:
   - **Strengths**: Highlight key competitive advantages and core capabilities, with all citations
   - **Weaknesses**: Address challenges honestly but constructively, with all citations
