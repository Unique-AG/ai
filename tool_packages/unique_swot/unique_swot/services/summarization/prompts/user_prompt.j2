Please create a compelling, investor-focused summary of the following SWOT analysis for {{ company_name }}.

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

**PRESERVE ALL CITATIONS**: Every source citation in the format [source1], [source2], etc. MUST be preserved exactly as it appears in the original report. When summarizing any fact, claim, or data point, you MUST include its original citation markers. Do not remove, modify, or omit any [sourceX] references.

**DO NOT CREATE TOP-LEVEL HEADERS**: The report template will automatically wrap your output with the `# Executive Overview` header. Your output should ONLY contain section headers starting with `##` (two hash marks), never `#` (one hash mark).

## Task Requirements:

Transform the detailed report below into a concise, accessible Executive Overview that:

1. **Opens with Company Context**: Begin with a `## Company Overview` section that positions {{ company_name }} in its market and explains its core business model or value proposition (2-3 paragraphs).

2. **Provides SWOT Snapshot**: Include a `## SWOT Snapshot` section with numbered subsections for each SWOT component:
   - **Strengths**: Highlight key competitive advantages and core capabilities, with all citations
   - **Weaknesses**: Address challenges honestly but constructively, with all citations
   - **Opportunities**: Emphasize market potential and strategic growth areas, with all citations
   - **Threats**: Contextualize risks and external challenges, with all citations

3. **Concludes with Synthesis**: End with a `## Conclusion` section that provides strategic perspective and investment implications.

4. **Explains Technical Elements**: 
   - Define all acronyms and technical terms when first introduced
   - Provide clear explanations of any technologies mentioned (e.g., if the company uses machine learning, blockchain, specific frameworks, or proprietary technology)
   - Help non-technical investors understand WHY these technologies matter for the business
   - Always keep the source citations with these explanations

5. **Maintains Investor Focus**: 
   - Connect insights to investment considerations
   - Highlight growth potential and market positioning
   - Provide strategic context for risks and opportunities
   - Emphasize what makes {{ company_name }} compelling (or concerning) as an investment

6. **Stays Grounded in Evidence**: Base all claims on the specific details provided in the source report, and preserve every citation.

## Required Output Structure:

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Your output must follow this EXACT structure. Do NOT include any `#` headers, only `##` and `###` headers.**

```
## Company Overview

[2-3 paragraphs introducing {{ company_name }}, its market position, business model, and value proposition. Include relevant citations where applicable.]

## SWOT Snapshot

### 1. Strengths

[A single focused paragraph highlighting the most critical strengths with citations]

### 2. Weaknesses

[A single focused paragraph covering key weaknesses with citations]

### 3. Opportunities

[A single focused paragraph describing main opportunities with citations]

### 4. Threats

[A single focused paragraph outlining significant threats with citations]

## Conclusion

[1-2 paragraphs synthesizing the overall investment perspective:
- Summarize the key takeaways from the SWOT analysis
- Provide a balanced view of {{ company_name }}'s strategic position
- Highlight the most critical factors for investment consideration
- Offer final thoughts on growth potential and risk profile
- Include relevant citations to support key points]
```

**Important formatting rules:**
- **START your output with `## Company Overview`** - do NOT include any `#` headers
- Use `##` for the three main sections (Company Overview, SWOT Snapshot, Conclusion)
- Use `###` for numbered SWOT components within the SWOT Snapshot (1. Strengths, 2. Weaknesses, 3. Opportunities, 4. Threats)
- Number the SWOT subsections 1, 2, 3, 4 sequentially
- Only include subsections for SWOT components that have content in the detailed report
- If a SWOT component doesn't exist in the report, skip that numbered subsection entirely and adjust the numbering accordingly
- Each SWOT subsection should be a single focused paragraph, not multiple paragraphs
- Preserve all `[sourceX]` citations within the content
- **NEVER use horizontal rules (---) as they don't render properly in the document format**
- The template will automatically add the `# Executive Overview` header, so do NOT include it yourself

Aim for a summary that is approximately 30-40% the length of the original report, while capturing all critical insights and maintaining ALL source citations.
