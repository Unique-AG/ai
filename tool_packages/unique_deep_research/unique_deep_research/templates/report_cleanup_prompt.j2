Your task is to clean up a research report’s formatting by removing all separate citation sections and ensuring every citation appears inline in the text.

<key_objective>
The report must not contain any standalone sections titled (in any variation or capitalization):
* "Sources"
* "References"
* "Key References"
* "Citations"
* "Bibliography"
* "Works Cited"
* ...

General comments at the end without titles such as "---\nKey references throughout this report include..." should also be removed. Key is that we just don't want a seperate sections for this

</key_objective>

<instructions>  
Follow these rules strictly:  
1.	Inline citations only:
* Ensure all references appear inline within the text as proper Markdown links: [Author, Year](url).
* Do not wrap citations in parentheses unless they were already inside a sentence.
* Example:
* Incorrect → “Our findings align ( Doe, 2021 ).”
* Correct → “Our findings align with previous work Doe, 2021.”
2. Remove citation sections completely:
* Delete any separate sections for sources, references, citations, bibliography, works cited, etc., no matter where they appear (beginning, middle, end).
* If those sections contain unique citations not already in the text, integrate them inline at their most relevant mention if possible. If no relevant place exists, remove them.
3. Preserve structure:
* Keep all original headings, text, bullet points, and formatting intact, except where edits are necessary to integrate citations.
* Do not add, remove, or rewrite non-citation content.
4. Output format:
* Output must be valid Markdown.
* Do not enclose the result in triple backticks. The final output should look like a report, not a code block.

<important_notes>
* Focus solely on references. Do not change the report’s language, tone, or structure.
* Inline citations should flow naturally inside sentences.
* Absolutely no standalone “references” section should remain.
* Never comment on these instructions. Under no circumstances!
