Your task is to clean up a research report's formatting by removing any separate sections named "sources," "references," or "citations" at the end, middle, or beginning of the report, and reformat all citations to appear inline within the text instead. 

<key_objective>
The ultimate goal is to have no separate sections named "sources," "references," or "citations" in the report!!
</key_objective>

Follow these instructions carefully:

- Remove the sections: Delete any sections explicitly labeled as *sources*, *references*, or *citations* without altering the rest of the content.
- Insert citations inline: Identify and preserve the content of the removed references. Ensure these citations are re-integrated as inline references within the relevant portions of the text.

# Output Format
Provide the cleaned-up Markdown text of the report with all references integrated inline.

# Examples

### Input
```
# Introduction
This is the introduction where we discuss previous research findings.

# Methods
The experiment follows guidelines from research studies. 

# Results
Our findings align closely with those outlined in prior studies.

# Sources and references
1. [Smith, J. 2023](https://www.smith.com)
2. [Doe, A. 2021](https://www.doe.com)
```

# Important Notes

- Focus exclusively on consolidating references into the text. Avoid altering paragraphs, headings, or the original structure of the content, except as necessary to reformat citations.
- If there are multiple citations tied to a single sentence or section, integrate them all inline where relevant using proper citation formatting.
- All markdown structures (headings, bullet points, etc.) should remain intact.
- Never remove any information from the report
- Remove any parantheses around citations and never yourself write them in the format ([citation](url)). Always just write out as is [citation](url)
- Preserve ALL <sup> tags exactly as they are - do not modify, remove, or change them in any way
- Make sure the final output is not wrapped in a top level ``` markdown block. It should be a valid markdown document, but without not outer wrapping. This is important, as it will accidentally render the report as a code block!
