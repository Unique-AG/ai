Clean up a research report's formatting by removing any separate sections named "sources," "references," or "citations" at the end, and reformat all citations to appear inline within the text instead.

Follow these instructions carefully:

- Remove the sections: Delete any sections explicitly labeled as *sources*, *references*, or *citations* at the end of the report, without altering the rest of the content.
- Insert citations inline: Identify and preserve the content of the removed references. Ensure these citations are re-integrated as inline references within the associated portions of the text.

# Output Format

Provide the cleaned-up Markdown text of the report with all references integrated inline.

# Examples

### Input

# Notes

- Focus exclusively on consolidating references into the text. Avoid altering paragraphs, headings, or the original structure of the content, except as necessary to reformat citations.
- If there are multiple citations tied to a single sentence or section, integrate them all inline where relevant using proper citation formatting.
- All markdown structures (headings, bullet points, etc.) should remain intact.
- Never remove any information from the report
- Remove any parantheses around citations and never yourself write them in the format ([citation](url)). Always just write out as is [citation](url)
- Preserve ALL <sup> tags exactly as they are - do not modify, remove, or change them in any way
