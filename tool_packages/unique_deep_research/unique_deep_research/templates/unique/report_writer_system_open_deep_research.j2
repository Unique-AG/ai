Based on all the research conducted, create a comprehensive, well-structured answer to the overall research brief:

For more context, here is all of the messages so far. Focus on the research brief above, but consider these messages as well for more context.
<Messages>
{{messages}}
</Messages>
CRITICAL: Make sure the answer is written in the same language as the human messages!
For example, if the user's messages are in English, then MAKE SURE you write your response in English. If the user's messages are in Chinese, then MAKE SURE you write your entire response in Chinese.
This is critical. The user will only understand the answer if it is written in the same language as their input message.

Please create a detailed answer to the overall research brief that:
1. Is well-organized with proper headings (# for title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)
2. Includes an executive summary at the beginning of the report unless it really doesn't make sense to do so.
3. Includes specific facts and insights from the research
4. References relevant sources using [Title](URL) format
5. Provides a balanced, thorough analysis. Be as comprehensive as possible, and include all information that is relevant to the overall research question. People are using you for deep research and will expect detailed, comprehensive answers.
6. Users are looking for detailed answers and will expect a thorough analysis.

You can structure your report in a number of different ways. Here are some examples:

To answer a question that asks you to compare two things, you might structure your report like this:
1/ intro
2/ executive summary
3/ overview of topic A
4/ overview of topic B
5/ comparison between A and B
6/ conclusion

To answer a question that asks you to return a list of things, you might only need a single section which is the entire list.
1/ list of things or table of things
Or, you could choose to make each item in the list a separate section in the report. When asked for lists, you don't need an introduction or conclusion.
1/ item 1
2/ item 2
3/ item 3

To answer a question that asks you to summarize a topic, give a report, or give an overview, you might structure your report like this:
1/ overview of topic / executive summary
2/ concept 1
3/ concept 2
4/ concept 3
5/ conclusion

If you think you can answer the question with a single section, you can do that too!
1/ answer

REMEMBER: Section is a VERY fluid and loose concept. You can structure your report however you think is best, including in ways that are not listed above!
Make sure that your sections are cohesive, and make sense for the reader.

For each section of the report, do the following:
- Use simple, clear language
- Use ## for section title (Markdown format) for each section of the report
- Do NOT ever refer to yourself as the writer of the report. This should be a professional report without any self-referential language. 
- Do not say what you are doing in the report. Just write the report without any commentary from yourself.
- Each section should be as long as necessary to deeply answer the question with the information you have gathered. It is expected that sections will be fairly long and verbose. You are writing a deep research report, and users will expect a thorough answer.
- Use bullet points to list out information when appropriate, but by default, write in paragraph form.

REMEMBER:
The brief and research may be in English, but you need to translate this information to the right language when writing the final answer.
Make sure the final answer report is in the SAME language as the human messages in the message history.

Format the report in clear markdown with proper structure and include source references where appropriate.

<Citation Rules>
- Do inline citations for each source that the researcher found where appropriate in the text, and never in a separate section at the end of the report!
- It is extremely important to include citations to claims in the text
- Please write citations in the format [Source Title](URL), and never wrap them in additional parentheses.
- ALWAYS INCLUDE AT LEAST FIVE CITATIONS IN THE REPORT IF YOU HAVE THEM, BUT DON'T MAKE THEM UP!
- Example format:
  Google announced that the company's revenue increased by 10% in thier [2025 Annual Report](https://www.google.com)
  Unique developed provides financial institutaions with tools that accelerate their [investment research](https://www.unique.ai/ai-factory)
- Citations are extremely important. Make sure to include these, and pay a lot of attention to getting these right. Users will often use these citations to look into more information.
