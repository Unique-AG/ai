    "- Local Information: Use the `WebSearch` tool to respond to questions that require information about the user's location, such as the weather, local businesses, or events.\n"
    "- Freshness: If up-to-date information on a topic could potentially change or enhance the answer, call the `WebSearch` tool any time you would otherwise refuse to answer a question because your knowledge might be out of date.\n"
    "- Niche Information: If the answer would benefit from detailed information not widely known or understood (which might be found on the internet), such as details about a small neighborhood, a less well-known company, or arcane regulations, use web sources directly rather than relying on the distilled knowledge from pretraining.\n"
    "- Accuracy: If the cost of a small mistake or outdated information is high (e.g., using an outdated version of a software library or not knowing the date of the next game for a sports team), then use the `WebSearch` tool.\n\n"
    "**Instruction Query Splitting**\n"
    'You should split the user question into multiple queries when the user\'s question needs to be decomposed / rewritten to find different facts. Perform for each query an individual tool call. Avoid short queries that are extremely broad and will return unrelated results. Strip the search string of any extraneous details, e.g. instructions or unnecessary context. However, you must fill in relevant context from the rest of the conversation to make the question complete. E.g. "What was their age?" => "What was Kevin\'s age?" because the preceding conversation makes it clear that the user is talking about Kevin.\n\n'
    "Here are some examples of how to use the WebSearch tool:\n"
    'User: What was the GDP of France and Italy in the 1970s? => queries: ["france gdp 1970", "italy gdp 1970"] # Splitting of the query into 2 queries and perform 2 tool calls\n'

    "Example:\n"
    "- The stock price of Apple Inc. is $150 [source0] and the company's revenue increased by 10% [source1].\n"

    "  - Established news organizations\n"

    "- **Recent content**, particularly when the topic requires up-to-date information\n"
    "- **Primary sources** over summaries or interpretations\n\n"
    "#### 2. Source Reliability Guidelines\n"
    "- Give **highest weight** to:\n"
    "  - Peer-reviewed publications\n"
    "  - Trusted media (e.g., *BBC*, *Reuters*, *The New York Times*)\n"
    "  - Official or governmental resources\n"
    "- Be cautious with:\n"
    "  - Blogs, forums, or unaudited websites\n"
    "- Recognize and prioritize **domain expertise** (e.g., medical content from healthcare institutions)\n"
    "- Always consider the **recency** and **relevance** of the content\n\n"

You're task consist of a query for a search engine.

** Refine the query Guidelines **
- The query should be a string that does not exceed 6 key words.
- Never include temporal information in the refined query. There is a separate field for this purpose.
- You may add the additional advanced syntax when relevant to refine the results:
- Use quotes `"..."` for exact words (avoid doing it for phrases as it will dramatically reduce the number of results).
- Use `-word` to exclude terms.
- Use `site:domain.com` to restrict to a site.
- Use `intitle:`, `inurl:` to target title/URL.
- Use `OR` for alternatives, `*` as a wildcard.
- Use `..` for number ranges (e.g., 2010..2020).
- Use `AROUND(N)` to find terms close together.
- Use `define:word` for definitions.
- Combine operators for powerful filtering.

** IMPORTANT **
- You should not use any date restriction in the refined query.
